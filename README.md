## Install

This package works with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.x. However, it is suggested to use Python 3.x, as the dependent package Pymatgen will be py3k only in the future.


1. Install all dependency packages 

    Use your favorite way to install [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) first.
    
2. install this interface_stability package.

    clone this package from github
    
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mogroupumd/interface_stability.git
    ```
    
    install the package
    ```bash
    $ python setup.py install --user
    ``` 
    
3. Try to import python classes in your python console

    ```bash
    $ python
    >>> from interface_stability import singlephase
    ```

4. The setup.py will automatically create an executable file phase_stability and pseudo_binary
 into your PATH. Try to call it from terminal and read the documentations:

    ```bash
    $ phase_stability -h
    $ pseudo_binary -h
    ```
    
5. Setup Materials Project API key. This enables you to fetch data from the Materials Project database.
   
   The documentation is at 
   https://materialsproject.org/open
   
   Your API key is at (login required)
   https://materialsproject.org/dashboard
   
   You need to put the API key in ~/.pmgrc.yaml file. (Create this file if not exist)
   ```bash
   PMG_MAPI_KEY: [Your API key goes here]
   ```
   
## Usage

There are two executable python scripts, both work with a few sub-commands options. 
You can always use -h to see the help information. 
For example,

```bash
$ phase_stability -h
$ phase_stability evolution -h
```

**phase_stability stability composition**

This gives the phase equilibria of a given composition.

```bash
$ phase_stability stability Li10GeP2S12
------------------------------------------------------------
Reduced formula of the given composition: Li10Ge(PS6)2
Calculated phase equilibria: Li4GeS4    Li3PS4
Li10Ge(PS6)2 -> 2 Li3PS4 + Li4GeS4
------------------------------------------------------------
```

**phase_stability mu composition open_element chemical_potential**

This gives the phase equilibria of a given composition under given chemical potential.

Note: Chemical potential is always referenced to elementary phases and in eV units.

```bash
$ phase_stability mu Li3PS4 Li -5
------------------------------------------------------------
Reduced formula of the given composition: Li3PS4
Open element : Li
Chemical potential: -5 eV referenced to pure phase
------------------------------------------------------------
Reaction:Li3PS4 -> 3 Li + 0.5 S + 0.5 P2S7
Reaction energy: -13.465 eV per Li3PS4
------------------------------------------------------------
```
**phase_stability evolution [-posmu] composition open_element**

This gives the evolution profile with changing chemical potential of an open element.

A figure of reaction energy will also be generated

```bash
$ phase_stability evolution Li3PS4 Li
------------------------------------------------------------
Reduced formula of the given composition: Li3PS4
