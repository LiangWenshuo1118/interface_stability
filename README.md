## interface_stability 

This is designed to help researchers to perform diffusion analysis from *ab inito* molecular dynamic 
(AIMD) simulations. It contains some useful python classes which can be integrated into your python
analysis code, and one easy-to-use executable python script which can perform diffusion analysis on
the terminal without further modification.


The executable python script (script/analyze_aimd.py) has two main functions:

1. Analyze diffusion properties from AIMD calculations at one single temperature. 

2. Analyze diffusion properties from AIMD calculations at multiple temperatures. 

    More information can be found by the behind code after you install the library

    ```bash
    analyze_aimd -h
    analyze_aimd diffusivity -h
    analyze_aimd arrhenius -h
    ```

## Install and test steps

1. Install all dependency and this library
    
    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ``` 
    
    if you have no root access, you may need to use
    
    ```bash
    python setup.py install --user
    ```
    
2. Try to import python classes in your python console

    ```python
    from aimd.diffusion import DiffusivityAnalyzer, ErrorAnalysisFromDiffusivityAnalyzer, \
    ArreheniusAnalyzer
    ```

3. The setup.py will automatically create an executable file analyze_aimd into your PATH. Try to
call it from terminal and read the documentations:

    ```bash
    analyze_aimd -h
    analyze_aimd diffusivity -h
    analyze_aimd arrhenius -h
    ```
    
4. Use the provided test files to perform diffusion analysis.
    
    a. go to the folder aimd/tests/tests_files/latp_md
    
    b. run in terminal
     ```bash
     analyze_aimd diffusivity Li+ RUN_ 10 29 3.2
     ``` 
    
    c. You can ignore the warning msgs. You will get the diffusion results. 
    The diffusivity is ~7.6e-5 cm^2/s, conductivity is ~583 mS/cm
    
    d. go to folder aimd/tests/tests_files/arrhenius 
    
    e. run in terminal
     ```bash
     analyze_aimd arrhenius D_T.csv -p POSCAR -T 300 -s Li+
     analyze_aimd arrhenius D_T.csv -p POSCAR -T 300 -s Li+ --plot
     ``` 
    
    f. You will get the arrhenius relationship of LATP. The conductivity at 300K is predicted to be 
    ~1.08 mS/cm, Ea is ~0.258 eV +- 0.017 eV. If your x11 windows settings are correct or you are at
    local computer, you will have a plot window pop up to show the arrhenius relationship for cmd with
    -plot option.
