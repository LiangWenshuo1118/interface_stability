## Install

This package works with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.x. However, it is suggested to use Python 3.x, as the dependent package Pymatgen will be py3k only in the future.


1. Install all dependency packages 

    Use your favorite way to install pymatgen and argparse first.
    
2. install this interface_stability package.

    clone this package from github
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mogroupumd/interface_stability.git
    ```
    
    install the package
    
    ```bash
    python setup.py install --user
    ``` 
    
3. Try to import python classes in your python console

    ```bash
    python
    >>> from interface_stability import singlephase
    ```

4. The setup.py will automatically create an executable file phase_stability and pseudo_binary
 into your PATH. Try to call it from terminal and read the documentations:

    ```bash
    phase_stability -h
    pseudo_binary -h
    ```
    
5. Setup Materials Project API key. This enables you to fetch data from the Materials Project database.
   
   The documentation is at 
   https://materialsproject.org/open
   
   Your API key is at (login required)
   https://materialsproject.org/dashboard
   
   You need to put the API key in ~/.pmgrc.yaml file. (Create this file if not exist)
   ```bash
   PMG_MAPI_KEY: [Your API key goes here]
   ```
   
## Usage

There are two executable python scripts:

1. scripts/phase_stability.py

2. scripts/pseudo_binary.py
